## README

## This works on .rbxl files up to 2014 !! (havent't tested it on newer ones, prob works unless it's terrain)

This only works if the file is UNENCRYPTED!

FOR TRANSPARENCY ON MATERIALS TO FIX: just add a gameobject to the scene, delete it, then save the scene and all transparent stuff'll get fixed

This is made for URP, but y'all can commit any changes for handling multiple pipelines

-# TODO (top is a do soon, lower is do later):

- Texturing option (with proper UV's!) - in but uv's are fucked up
